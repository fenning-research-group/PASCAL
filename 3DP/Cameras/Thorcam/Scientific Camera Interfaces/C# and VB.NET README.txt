C# and VB.NET README

For C# and VB.NET support for all Thorlabs DCCxxx and DCUxxx cameras, please see the DCx Camera Support folder typically installed at C:\Program Files\Thorlabs\Scientific Imaging\DCx Camera Support.

For C# and VB.NET support for all Thorlabs Scientific Cameras (340xxx, 1500xxx, 1501xxx, 4070xxx, 8050xxx, 8051xxx, CS2100-USB, CC215MU, CS135xxx, CS165xxx, CS235xxx, CS505xxx, CS895xxx), please follow these directions:

1. Install ThorCam and the appropriate drivers using the installer CD that came with a camera or download an installer from the appropriate product page at Thorlabs.com.

2. Copy the managed DLLs from

 SDK\DotNet Toolkit\bin\Managed_32_lib\*.dll
 or
 SDK\DotNet Toolkit\bin\Managed_64_lib\*.dll 
 
 to the a folder with your executable file (output folder).

3. See the following guides found in the Documentation folder (usually C:\Program Files\Thorlabs\Scientific Imaging\Documentation\Scientific Camera Documents):

 TSI_Camera_DotNET-LabVIEW-MATLAB_Programming_Guide.chm
 
4. The following DLLs must be referenced by your .NET (C# or VB.Net) projects:

 Thorlabs.TSI.Core.dll
 Thorlabs.TSI.CoreInterfaces.dll
 Thorlabs.TSI.ImageData.dll
 Thorlabs.TSI.ImageDataInterfaces.dll
 Thorlabs.TSI.TLCamera.dll
 Thorlabs.TSI.TLCameraInterfaces.dll
 thorlabs_tsi_camera_sdk1_cli.dll
 
 Color cameras should also reference these additional DLLs:
 
 Thorlabs.TSI.ColorInterfaces.dll
 Thorlabs.TSI.ColorProcessor.dll
 Thorlabs.TSI.Demosaicker.dll
 
 Polarization cameras should also reference these additional DLLs:
 Thorlabs.TSI.PolarizationInterfaces.dll
 Thorlabs.TSI.PolarizationProcessor.dll
 
 The remaining DLLs should be copied to the output folder, but not referenced--they will be loaded dynamically.
 
5. Set the Project Platform for each of your .NET projects to be explicitly x64 or x86, not AnyCPU.
