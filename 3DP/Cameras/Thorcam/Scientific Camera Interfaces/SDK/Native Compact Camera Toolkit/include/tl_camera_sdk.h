*
* \section dotnet_section Getting Started
* Getting started programming Thorlabs scientific cameras is straightforward. This guide describes
* how to program Thorlabs scientific cameras using compiled languages such as C or C++. Separate guides are available for Python, C#/VB.Net, LabVIEW, or MATLAB languages.
*
* NOTE: This guide shows function type definitions in ALL_CAPITAL_LETTERS and the corresponding function pointers in all_lowercase_letters. For example, after calling tl_camera_sdk_dll_initialize, the function pointer tl_camera_open_sdk is available with a type definition of TL_CAMERA_OPEN_SDK.
*
* All camera and mono-to-color functions are thread-safe, so no additional thread-locking is required.
*
* There are two approaches to getting images from a camera: Poll for images from any thread or register a callback that is automatically invoked on a worker thread whenever images are received from the camera. The following steps describe the order in which the APIs should be called. It is important to perform all clean-up steps at the end to avoid crashes.
*
* - Call tl_camera_sdk_dll_initialize to dynamically load the SDK DLL and get handles to its exported functions. Ensure that all required DLLs are in the same folder as the executable or discoverable in the Windows PATH variable.
* - Initialize the SDK by calling tl_camera_open_sdk.
* - Discover the serial numbers of all connected cameras by calling tl_camera_discover_available_cameras. This step must be called at least once before attempting to open any camera.
* - Open a connection to a camera by calling tl_camera_open_camera with its serial number.
* - Set camera properties like exposure, operation mode, and number of frames per trigger by calling the appropriate API functions such as tl_camera_set_exposure, tl_camera_set_operation_mode, and tl_camera_set_frames_per_trigger_zero_for_unlimited, respectively.
* - Optionally, register a callback function to enable your application to receive a notification when an image is available by calling tl_camera_set_frame_available_callback. IMPORTANT: This notification will arrive on a worker thread, and blocking this thread too long will force incoming frames to drop.
* - Prepare the camera to send images to your application by calling tl_camera_arm. After arming, only a few parameters can be set such as exposure time. See the individual parameters for which ones are available once armed.
* - Command the camera to start delivering images by calling tl_camera_issue_software_trigger or by setting up the camera to respond to external hardware triggers by setting the operation mode.
* - If a callback is registered, then the SDK will invoke the registered callback each time an image is received; otherwise, poll for an image in a loop or on a timer using tl_camera_get_pending_frame_or_null.
* - When your application has completed acquiring images, stop the camera by calling tl_camera_disarm.
* - Close the connection to the camera by calling tl_camera_close_camera.
* - Clean up and release SDK resources by calling tl_camera_close_sdk.
* - Call tl_camera_sdk_dll_terminate to unload the SDK DLL.
