# Constants for the hardware modules that compose PASCAL
gantry:
  # communcation
  serialid: "55838333932351108212"
  pollingrate: 0.05 #delay (seconds) between sending a command and reading a response
  timeout: 15 #max time (seconds) allotted to gantry motion before flagging a movement error
  # movement
  positiontolerance: 0.05 #tolerance (mm) for movements to be considered complete
  speed_max: 10000 #max gantry speed, mm/min
  speed_min: 500 #min gantry speed, mm/min
  zhop_height: 20 #vertical clearance (mm) to use when moving between two points. will move this amount above the highest z point
  idle_coordinates: [288,165,55.5] #coordinates to move the gantry to when idle, mainly to avoid cameras

gripper:
  width_max: 28  #maximum opening width (mm)
  width_min: 6.5 #minimum opening width (mm)
  angle_max: 60  #servo angle corresponding to max width
  angle_min: 0   #servo angle corresponding to min width
  extra_opening_width: 2 #extra width (mm) to open gripper when moving to pick up a sample
  idle_timeout: 30 #gripper idle time (seconds) after which automatically closes. To prevent servo burnout (fighting the spring to stay open)
  
hotplate:
  p0: [100,100,100] #initial guess [x,y,z] coordinates for gantry to center over bottom left corner slot. Safer to overestimate z value here to avoid collisions

liquidhandler:
  pollingrate: 0.05 #delay (seconds) between checks for new commands to push to liquid handler server

sampletray:
  p0: [100,100,100] #initial guess [x,y,z] coordinates for gantry to center over bottom left corner slot. Safer to overestimate z value here to avoid collisions

spincoater:
  # communication
  serialid: "558383339323513140D1" #hardware ID of spincoater arduino. Used to find correct COM port
  pollingrate: 0.5 #delay (seconds) between communication to the arduino
  baudrate: 57600 #communcation baudrate to talk to arduino
  terminator: "\n" #terminator to signify end of line to arduino
  # movement
  p0: [52, 126, 41] #initial guess [x,y,z] coordinates for gantry to center over the chuck. Safer to overestimate z value here to avoid collisions
  rpm_max: 9000 #maximum angular velocity (rpm) the spincoater can hit
  rpm_min: 1000 #minimum angular velocity (rpm) the spincoater can hit
