# Constants for the hardware modules that compose PASCAL
gantry:
  # communcation
  # serialid: "55838333932351108212" #LINUX ONLY hardware ID of gantry control board. Used to find correct COM port
  vendorid: "1EAF" #WINDOWS ONLY can be determined by https://interworks.com/blog/ijahanshahi/2014/07/18/identify-vid-pid-usb-device/
  productid: "0004" #WINDOWS ONLY
  pollingrate: 0.05 #delay (seconds) between sending a command and reading a response
  timeout: 15 #max time (seconds) allotted to gantry motion before flagging a movement error

  # movement
  positiontolerance: 0.05 #tolerance (mm) for movements to be considered complete
  speed_max: 10000 #max gantry speed, mm/min
  speed_min: 500 #min gantry speed, mm/min
  zhop_height: 20 #vertical clearance (mm) to use when moving between two points. will move this amount above the highest z point
  idle_coordinates: [288,165,55.5] #coordinates to move the gantry to when idle, mainly to avoid cameras
  x_max: 797.0 #max x position (mm)
  x_min: 0     #min x position (mm)
  y_max: 165.0 #max y position (mm)

gripper:
  width_max: 28  #maximum opening width (mm)
  width_min: 6.5 #minimum opening width (mm)
  angle_max: 60  #servo angle corresponding to max width
  angle_min: 2   #servo angle corresponding to min width
  extra_opening_width: 2 #extra width (mm) to open gripper when moving to pick up a sample
  slow_movement_interval: 0.7 #time (s) between intermediate servo setpoints when opening/closing slowly
  idle_timeout: 30 #gripper idle time (seconds) after which automatically closes. To prevent servo burnout (fighting the spring to stay open)
  
hotplate:
  p0: [100,100,100] #initial guess [x,y,z] coordinates for gantry to center over bottom left corner slot. Safer to overestimate z value here to avoid collisions

  pollingrate: 0.05 #delay (seconds) between checks for new commands to push to liquid handler server
  
sampletray:
  p0: [100,100,100] #initial guess [x,y,z] coordinates for gantry to center over bottom left corner slot. Safer to overestimate z value here to avoid collisions
