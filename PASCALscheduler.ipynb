    "# Configurable closed-loop optimization with Ax `Scheduler`\n",
    "\n",
    "*We recommend reading through the [\"Developer API\" tutorial](https://ax.dev/tutorials/gpei_hartmann_developer.html) before getting started with the `Scheduler`, as using it in this tutorial will require an Ax `Experiment` and an understanding of the experiment's subcomponents like the search space and the runner.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contents:\n",
    "1. **Scheduler and external systems for trial evalution** –– overview of how scheduler works with an external system to run a closed-loop optimization.\n",
    "2. **Set up a mock external system** –– creating a dummy external system client, which will be used to illustrate a scheduler setup in this tutorial.\n",
    "3. **Set up an experiment according to the mock external system** –– set up a runner that deploys trials to the dummy external system from part 2 and a metric that fetches trial results from that system, then leverage those runner and metric and set up an experiment.\n",
    "4. **Set up a scheduler**, given an experiment.\n",
    "   1. Create a scheduler subclass to poll trial status.\n",
    "   2. Set up a generation strategy using an auto-selection utility.\n",
    "5. **Running the optimization** via `Scheduler.run_n_trials`.\n",
    "6. **Leveraging SQL storage and experiment resumption** –– resuming an experiment in one line of code.\n",
    "7. **Configuring the scheduler** –– overview of the many options scheduler provides to configure the closed-loop down to granular detail.\n",
    "8. **Advanced functionality**:\n",
    "   1. Reporting results to an external system during the optimization.\n",
    "   2. Using `Scheduler.run_trials_and_yield_results` to run the optimization via a generator method."

    "## 7. Configuring the scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "`Scheduler` exposes many options to configure the exact settings of the closed-loop optimization to perform. A few notable ones are:\n",
    "- `trial_type` –– currently only `Trial` and not `BatchTrial` is supported, but support for `BatchTrial`-s will follow,\n",
    "- `tolerated_trial_failure_rate` and `min_failed_trials_for_failure_rate_check` –– together these two settings control how the scheduler monitors the failure rate among trial runs it deploys. Once `min_failed_trials_for_failure_rate_check` is deployed, the scheduler will start checking whether the ratio of failed to total trials is greater than `tolerated_trial_failure_rate`, and if it is, scheduler will exit the optimization with a `FailureRateExceededError`,\n",
    "- `ttl_seconds_for_trials` –– sometimes a failure in a trial run means that it will be difficult to query its status (e.g. due to a crash). If this setting is specified, the Ax `Experiment` will automatically mark trials that have been running for too long (more than their 'time-to-live' (TTL) seconds) as failed,\n",
    "- `run_trials_in_batches` –– if `True`, the scheduler will attempt to run trials not by calling `Scheduler.run_trial` in a loop, but by calling `Scheduler.run_trials` on all ready-to-deploy trials at once. This could allow for saving compute in cases where the deployment operation has large overhead and deploying many trials at once saves compute. Note that using this option successfully will require your scheduler subclass to implement `MySchedulerSubclass.run_trials` and `MySchedulerSubclass.poll_available_capacity`.\n",
